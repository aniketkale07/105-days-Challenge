----------STRING-----------

** what is String?
    String is the collection of charachter.

** what is StringBuilder?
    StringBuilder in Java is a class used to create mutable (modifiable) 
    sequences of characters, unlike the String class, which creates immutable 
    objects. This means you can change the contents of a StringBuilder object 
    without creating a new object each time, making it 
    more efficient when working with strings that change frequently.

** Common Methods of StringBuilder:
    append(String str): Appends the specified string to this character sequence.
    insert(int offset, String str): Inserts the string at the specified position.
    delete(int start, int end): Removes characters in the specified range.
    replace(int start, int end, String str): Replaces characters in the specified range with the provided string.
    reverse(): Reverses the character sequence.
    toString(): Converts the StringBuilder to a String.
    

** what is String Buffer ?
        Is class in java which represent ,mutable sequence of charachter.
    it provide of alternative of  immutable string class, allowing you to modify the string without creating new 
    object of String


    public class StringBufferExample {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        sb.append("Hello");
        sb.append(" ");
        sb.append("world");
        String message = sb.toString();
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
 
** String Constant pool?
    String object are most used data object in java. java as a special arrangement
    to store the string object. String Constant pool is one such arrangement
    it is a pool of string object which are used in the program. it is a memory location
    where all the string literal are stored. it is a pool of string object which are used in
        the program. it is a memory location where all the string literal are stored.

** 
StringBuilder vs. StringBuffer:
    StringBuilder is not thread-safe, meaning it cannot be used safely in
    multi-threaded environments.
    StringBuffer is similar to StringBuilder but is thread-safe, 
    with synchronized methods to ensure safe use by multiple threads.
