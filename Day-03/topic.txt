*** Method--> A method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called explicitly.
    It consists of:
        Return Type: What the method returns (or void if nothing is returned).
        Method Name: Can be the same or different from the class name.
        Arguments/Parameters: Values passed to the method.
        Method Body: The actual logic of the method.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. METHOD OVERRIDING --> 
    Method overriding occurs when a method in a child (derived) class has the same signature (name and parameter list) as a method in the parent (super) class.
    This allows the child class to provide a specific implementation of the method.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHAT IS CONSTRUCTOR?
    A constructor is a special type of method that is called when an instance (object) of a class is created.
    The constructor's name must be the same as the class name, and it does not have a return type.
    It is used to initialize the objectâ€™s properties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 METHOD OVERLOADING-->
    Which allow us to create multiple method with same signature in single class with 
    different Implementation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Array-- > Is The Collection of Similear item
            Arrays are fixed in size and can be of any primitive or reference type.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Access Modifier --> private public protected default
        public : Access all over the package and outside
        private : Access only within declared classes
        protected : Access only the class and derived class either package or outside
        default : Access only within package


Summary Table of Key Concepts:
Concept             |       	Description
Method	            | Block of code that performs a task, must be called explicitly.
Method Overriding	| Child class redefines a method of the parent class with the same signature.
Constructor	        | Special method called when an object is created, used to initialize the object.
Method Overloading	| Same method name with different parameters, providing different implementations.
Array	            | Collection of elements of the same type, fixed in size.
Access Modifiers	| Controls visibility (public, private, protected, default).
