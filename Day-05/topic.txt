------------OOPS---------------------
1.WHAT IS OOPS?
    OOPS stands for the object oriented programming , in java everything is trying to map in the object
    OOPS is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design applications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. 4 PILLER OF OOPS?
    There are 4 pillers 1.ENCAPSULATION 
                        2.INHERITANCE
                        3.ABSTRACTION
                        4.PLOYMORPHISM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.CLASSES AND OBJECT
    CLASSES---> class is the collection of the methods and objects. 
    OBJECT----> the object is the real-time entity having some state and behavior. 
    object is an instance of the class having instance of variable.
4.WHAT IS INHERITANCE?
    Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and 
    behaviours of a parent object . it is represent parent-child relation.
     Types of Inheritance-->
                             1.Single Inheritance--> There is only one super class and one derived class
                                --> signal derived class inheritated from signal super class
                                ---> Super class ----> Derived Class
                            2. MultiLevel Inheritance -- > A derived class inheritateed from super class
                                which is already inheritated from anoter super class
                                ------super class ----> super class ---> Derived class
                            3.Hierachical Inheritance--> In Hierachical inheritance more than 1 derived class is 
                                are inheritated from signal super class
                            4.Hybrid Inheritance --> in Hybrid inheritance is combination of the two or more 
                                Inheritance like --> MultiLevel inheritace with single Inheritance

5. this keyword--> the this keyword refere to the current class object
6. super keyword--> Refer to the current object is super class
