105-Days Challenge
In this 105-day challenge, I am aiming to cover the basics of Java full-stack development. I'm revisiting essential topics and putting in my best effort to cover the key points and syllabus comprehensively. If I happen to miss any points during a day, I encourage you to verify them as well.

I advise you not to blindly rely on my content. This is a learning journey for both of us, and it’s important to cross-check the material for a thorough understanding.

There will be days when some topics might not be covered entirely, and that's okay. Don't blame yourself if things take longer than planned—I face the same situation often. Some concepts take time to fully grasp and revise.

Over these 105 days, my primary focus will be on web development with Spring Boot using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

Additional Points:
Gaining basic knowledge of different architecture types, including monolithic, microservices, layered, and deployment architectures.
