-------------basic of java --------------------
1.what is java? 
    Is a programming language and computing  platform. 
    Released by sum microsystem in 1995 . Based on OOP 
    Used to develop large scale application. 
    Is a platform independent.
    Desktop application -> Media player, Antivirus
    Mobile application -> Android
    Web application -> javaTpoint

2.Features of Java -> 
    1. Simple -> easy to use and learn . easy syntax 
    2. Object Oriented : Everything in java is object Oriented.
    3.platform independent : excute on Multiple platform because of its bytecode
    4.secured : no explicit pointer , programs runs inside virtual machine
    5. Robust : error handling and memory management is done by JVM
    6. Architecture Neutral : same binary can run on any platform
    7. Portable : same binary can run on any platform
    8. Multithreaded : can run multiple thread at same time
    9. Dynamic : can load class at runtime
    10. High Performance : JVM optimize the code at runtime

3. difference between java and c++
    1. platform independent : java is platform independent while c++ is not
    2. memory management : java is automatic memory management while c++ is manual memory management
    3. object oriented : java is object oriented while c++ is not
    4. syntax : java is easy to learn and use while c++ is difficult to learn and use
    5. multithreading : java is multithreaded while c++ is not


4.DataTypes in java?
    A.Primitive Datatypes : 
        1.boolean -> For Yes NO values2
        2.int -> For Integer value
        3.float -> for decimal values --> single precision 32 bit
        4.double ->  for double precision values --> 64 bit
        5.long -> store 64 bit two's Complemnet Integer
        6.short -> store 16 bit signed two's Complemnet Integer
        7.char -> store single character values
        8.byte -> store 8 bit two's Complemnet Integer
    B. Non- Primitive DataTypes
        1.Array - > is the collection of similear Primitive dataTypes
        2.Object -> is the real time entity having some state and behaviour
        3.String -> Is the collection (Array or set) of char 

5.what is Wrapper Class?
    The Wrapper class is an object class that encapsulting primitive dataTypes 
    to object class.
    It is final and immutable.. 
    ** AutoBoxing -> primitive to object class
    ** Unboxing -> object class to primitive
