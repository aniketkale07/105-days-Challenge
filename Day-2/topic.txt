1.what is jvm, jre jdk?
    JVM --> java Virtual Machine --> is a part of JRE
        JVM is the type of interpeter responsible for converting bytecode into machine
        readable code.
        JVM itself is platform dependent but it interprets the bytecode which is the platform
        so, the java is a platform independent..

    JDK --> Java Develpment Kit
        Which is provide the Environment to develope and excute the code.
        JDK Provide two things --> 1. Develpment Tools -> To Provide Environment to develope
        java programs.
        2. JRE : - > TO Execute java program and applications.

    JRE --> java Runtime Environment 
        JRE facilitates the execution of programs developed in java . 
        1.JVM 
        2.Runtime class libraries -> There are a set of Core Classes libraries that are
            required for the execution of java programs.
        3.User Interface toolkits -> eg. Swing , AWT
        4.Develpment Technolgies -> 
            1.java plug-in -> Enable the execution of a java applet on the browser
            2.java web start -> enable remote-deployment of an application.

2.operator in java?
    A.Arithmetic Operation
        1. + -> It is Used to Addition
        2. - -> It is used to Subtraction
        3. * -> It is used to Multiplication
        4. / -> it is used to Division Operation
        5. % -> Modulo Division Operator .. (Remainder)

    B.Shift operator -> 
        1. left shift operator --> << is used to shift all of the bits
        in a value to the left side of a specified number of times
             << -> (10 << 2)  --> 10*2^2  = 10 * 4 = 40
                    (10 << 3)  --> 10*2^3 = 10 * 8 = 80
        2.Right Shift operator-->  >>
            (10 >> 2) --> 10 / 2^2 --> 10 / 4 -- > 4

    C. Relational Operator -> 
        1. < --- is less than
        2. > --- is Greater than
        3. == --- Is equal to 
        4. <= --- is less than or equal to 
        5. >= --- is Greater than or equal to
        6. != --- is Not equal

    D. Bitwise Operator
        For Manipulation of data at values of bit level. These operator is used for
        testing the bits, or shifting them to the right or left. 
        --> Not apply to the float and double
        1.& --> Bitwise AND
        2. ! --> Bitwise OR
        3. ^ --> Bitwise exclusive
        4. ~ --> one's Complemnet
        5. << --> shift left
        6. >> --> shift Right
        7. >>> --> shift Right with zero fill

    E. Logical Operator
        1. && --> Logical AND
        2. || --> Logical OR
        3. !  --> Logical NOT

    F. Ternary Operator

    G. Assignment Operator
